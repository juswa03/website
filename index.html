        <h1>Impact of Human Activities on Ecosystems</h1>
        <p >Human activities have a profound impact on ecosystems, shaping the environment in both positive and
            negative ways. As the dominant species on Earth, humans rely on natural resources for survival and
            development, but our actions often disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems. From deforestation and
            pollution to unsustainable farming practices, these activities threaten biodiversity, alter climate patterns, and
            degrade land, water, and air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the consequences of human actions is crucial for promoting sustainable practices that
            minimize harm to the environment. This module explores the effects of human activities on ecosystems,
            identifies key pollutants, and highlights conservation strategies to protect our planet. By learning how to
            reduce our ecological footprint, we can contribute to a healthier, more sustainable future for all living
            organisms.
        </p>

            Let’s delve into the ways human activities influence ecosystems and discover how we can become better
stewards of the Earth.<br>

        <h2>(LESSON PROPER)</h2>
        <h2>Lesson 1 Impact of Human Activities in an Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>The Earth was created with all abundance and variety of living and non-living organisms, with the sun as the
            source of natural energy to all that inhabit it. Man is given dominion over all the creation. Hence, they may
            utilize resources found in it to survive and progress. However, the weight of human activities takes a toll on
            the environment. Human activities affect environmental conditions from multiple perspectives such as
            unsustainable farming practices, emission of harmful substances into the air, and introduction of pollutants to
            bodies of water, land, and air.
        </p>
        <p>
            A pollutant is a harmful material that enters the biosphere through the land, air, or water. The most common
            human activity that causes water pollutants to get introduced to the aquatic ecosystem is by using fertilizer,
            pesticides, and herbicides near bodies of water. When it rains, these chemicals get into rivers, creeks, or even
            seas, thus contaminating or worse, polluting it. The build-up of fertilizers may cause algal bloom resulting in
            the death of those bodies of water.
        </p>
        <p>Improper waste disposal is another crucial issue. People litter everywhere to the extent that canals are being
            blocked by numerous pieces of garbage. R.A 9003 enacted in the Philippines in 2003 prohibits open dumping
            of garbage as its leachate pollutes the soil and underground water aside from the fact that it invites all sorts of
            insects and rodents that carry infectious diseases and respiratory problems. Despite this standing Act, open
            dumping of garbage is still widely practiced all over the country. Also, farmers extensively practice the use of
            inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to ensure productivity. Using these pollutants more often can
            alter the nutrient of the soil resulting in the loss of organic matter in it. Furthermore, misuse of our forests
            such as ruthless cutting of immature trees, illegal logging, and operating kaingin systems cause soil erosion
            and flash floods. The air gets polluted when there is a clear or invisible particle or gas found to mix in its
            original, normal composition. Smog - a gray-brown haze formed by a combination of chemicals is a sign of air
            pollution. It is mainly caused by human activities such as smoke-belching and congestion of vehicles during
            heavy traffic causing a higher concentration of carbon monoxide, which in turn causes respiratory ailments to
            humans over long exposure to it. Moreover, some human practices that contribute to greenhouse gases are
            the burning of plastics and combustion of fossil fuel, use of aerosols and CFC-containing products. Popularly
            known greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide that hasten global warming.
        </p>
        <p>Humans interfere with the ecosystem by disrupting the ecological balance. They are the highest consumers in
            numerous food pyramids. To increase food production, man uses methods and farming practices that affect
            food chains and food webs, such as monocultures, the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.
            Monoculture, also known as monocropping, is a farming practice that involves the continuous cultivation of a
            single crop on the same large land areas without change. For farmers, this is practical since it facilitates the
            specialization of the sort of crop to plant to maximize the uptake of the nutrients the soil offers. However,
            planting the same crop in the same place over the years takes up most of the same nutrients leaving the soil
            weak and unable to support healthy plant growth leading to poor crop yield. Also, monocrops usually require
            large amounts of chemical fertilizers. Constant and uncontrolled use of chemical fertilizers may increase soil
            acidity, thus destroying soil structure. Monocropping also gives rise to resistant pests and diseases that
            account for chemical treatment. Farmers spray their crops with insecticides to kill insect pests, and with
            herbicides to kill weeds. An herbicideis a chemical used to destroy and stop the growth of plants. However,
            the chemicals also destroy other organisms, including beneficial insects and soil organisms that help in decay.
            Therefore, wise management of natural resources should be taken into consideration to mitigate the negative
            impacts of human activities in the environment and thus support sustainability, the prevention of the
            decreasing of natural resources to maintain an ecological balance. Conservation is the careful preservation
            and protection of natural resources. So, as a steward of the earth, let us help one another to make our
            environment a better place to live in for us and for the next generation.
        </p>

        <h3>The following are among the recommended desirable practices to conserve natural resources:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stop the kaingin system.</li>
            <li>Use crop rotation method.</li>
            <li>Use insects to combat other insects.</li>
            <li>Grow different kinds of crops instead of only one crop.</li>
            <li>Apply organic farming using natural fertilizers for crops.</li>
            <li>Observe proper disposal of waste.</li>
            <li>Use the 3Rs method (reuse, reduce and recycle).</li>
            <li>Use appropriate size of nets when fishing.</li>
            <li>Do not engage in illegal mining, logging, and fishing.</li>
            <li>Minimize the use of CFC sprays.</li>
